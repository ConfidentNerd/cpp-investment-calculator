# cpp-investment-calculator
A C++ command-line application that calculates and compares investment growth over time.

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ command-line application which is designed to visualize how different compound interests affect investments over time, by providing users with a year-by-year breakdown of how their initial investment can grow over the years, and what their earned interest would be for different interest rates, both with and without additional monthly deposits.

## CS210 Assignment Reflection
To make sure the program is maintainable and adaptable, I adhered to OOP principles by encapsulating the mathematical logic within a dedicated class, separating the declarations (`.h`) from the implementations (`.cpp`), stuck to consistent and readable naming conventions, and separated helper functions from the main code.

The most challenging aspect was translating the university assignment requirements into actual code. I overcame this by carefully planning out the pseudocode before starting, as well as reading official C++ documentation and "Learn X in Y minutes" whenever I wasn't sure on the syntax. Looking forward, the code could be improved by integrating file I/O to export the data into a CSV format, which would make the tool more practical for real-world tracking, as well as moving from a command-line interface to a GUI to improve the overall user experience.

By building this app, I've practiced writing clean OOP code, separating concerns, and input validation which are highly transferable to most software development roles, regardless of the tech stack.
